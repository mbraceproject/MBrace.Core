module internal MBrace.SampleRuntime.Types

// Provides facility for the execution of cloud jobs.
// In this context, a job denotes a single work item to be sent
// to a worker node for execution. Jobs may span multiple threads
// but are bound to a single process. A cloud workflow that has
// been passed continuations is a typical example of such a job.
