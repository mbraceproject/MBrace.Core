// Cloud<'T> is a continuation-based computation that can be distributed.
// It takes two parameters, an ExecutionContext and a continuation triple.
// Importantly, the two values must remain distinct in order for distribution
// to be actuated effectively. ExecutionContext contains resources specific
// to the local executing process (like System.Threading.CancellationToken or open sockets)
// and is therefore not serializable, whereas Continuation<'T> is intended for
// distribution. This is the reason why continuations themselves carry the type signature
//
//      ExecutionContext -> contValue -> unit
//
// to avoid capturing local-only state in closures. In other words, this means that
// cloud workflows form a continuation over reader monad.
